# Problems Encountered

One problem that our group encountered during the project was with the web scraping of our dataset of speeches. The website for the American Presidency Project was one that used HTML. Because of this, we were unable to use the web scraping method properly. To get around this, Jordan had to copy and paste the text of each President’s speech into .txt file. Doing this allowed us to properly analyze the content of the Presidential speeches.

Another challenge that our group had was with visualizations. The main dataset we chose to analyze was all text due to it being a compilation of speech transcripts. Because of this were weren’t able to make vivid graphics and visualizations in Tableau like we worked on during class. Instead, we worked to take screenshots of Overview with part of the data we used for the project.
