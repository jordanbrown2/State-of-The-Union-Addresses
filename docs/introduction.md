# Introduction

Historians have long studied the American Presidency, from the policies and personalities of each president. In addition, scholars have also examined the growth of executive power from its intended role outlined by the United States Constitution. We decided to search for connections between the rhetoric of the presidents and the growth of executive power by examining the State of the Union Addresses and Joint Addresses to Congress. While there are other document sets that could have been examined, the State of the Union Address gives one of the most, if not the most, comprehensive look at a president's policy agenda.

Sanctioned by Article III, Section II of the United States Constitution, the State of the Union Address allows a president to outline policy recommendations to Congress and highlight national priorities. The address may also be used to reflect on the progress of the union or events that transpired during the previous year. While the State of the Union address is delivered via a televised speech today, it was historically expressed as a written statement to Congress. Thomas Jefferson began this process in 1801, and it continued for over a century until the presidency of Woodrow Wilson in 1913.

Therefore, some scholars argue that the "modern rhetorical presidency" began with Wilson. The advent of the Wilson's successor, Warren Harding continued the practice of giving an in-person speech, but Coolidge and Hoover reverted back to written addresses. Franklin Delano Roosevelt resumed the State of the Union Address as a speech, and this method has continued to the present day, with few exceptions. Roosevelt was also the first president to deliver the State of the Union Address at night, the reasoning being that he could reach a wider audience. The advent of the radio and television allowed these two (and future) presidents to deliver the address not just to Congress but the people of the United States. For these reasons, scholars debate whether it was Wilson or Roosevelt that began the "modern rhetorical presidency".

Based on the information surrounding the State of the Union Addresses, we have decided to further examine two specific elements. First, is there a difference in rhetoric between written and spoken addresses? If so, what are some differences and factors may have contributed to them. The State of the Union Address in its modern form has become a televised spectacle, which differs greatly from its more reserved role throughout the nineteenth century. The rise in international prestige for the United States following the World Wars coupled with the rise in executive power may have also created a change in the rhetoric of the addresses.

The second element that we wish to further examine is the debate over who began the "modern rhetorical presidency". While scholars that we have researched argue Woodrow Wilson or Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we are arguing that it actually began with Ronald Reagan. Reagan began a practice in 1981 of giving an Address to a Joint Session of Congress shortly after being inaugurated that is still continued to this day, with the most recent given by Donald Trump in February of this year. Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy were the first two presidents to give such a speech, but the practice was discontinued until Reagan's presidency. We will also examine the two speeches by Eisenhower and Kennedy to determine if they contain elements that influenced Reagan.
