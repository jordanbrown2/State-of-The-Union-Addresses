# Next Steps

There are several next steps that we can take with this project. To start, we only examined transcripts of State of the Union Addresses this time around, but audio recordings and videos of the certain addresses are available for examination. We will most likely have to find a tool(s) that can analyze audio and video files, but adding these mediums to the transcripts gives us an additional lens to analyze the addresses. Media would allow us to compare public speaking tools such as posture, gesticulation, and tone. Many modern State of the Union Addresses are available for viewing on YouTube, and can easily be converted into mp3 and mp4 files. Below are several links to various State of the Union Addresses.

The American Presidency Project database has over 120,000 records, providing many opportunities for further research into the presidency. Two data sets in particular that can give further insight into the rhetoric of the presidents are the Inaugural and Farewell Addresses. Like the State of the Union Addresses, the Inaugural Addresses is a complete set, from Washington to Trump, but the Farewell Addresses set only includes speeches from several presidents. The Weekly Presidential Addresses from 1982 to the present day are also available, and provide a more regular glimpse of modern presidential rhetoric. Additionally, an examination of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Fireside Chats would give us insight into his rhetoric when speaking to the entire nation during crises of the Great Depression and World War II.

While seemingly unrelated, the presidential election debate transcripts from 1960 to 2016 allow a glimpse of the rhetoric of presidents as candidates. Various modern presidents can be compared by their rhetoric as a candidate versus as a sitting president, using the debate transcripts and the documents mentioned above. The amount of data available via The American Presidency Project alone allows for more research projects that expand on what was found in this examination of the State of the Union Addresses and Addresses to a Joint Session of Congress.
